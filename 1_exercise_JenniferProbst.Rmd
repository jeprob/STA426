#Exercise

#Sampling
```{r}
y <- seq(-2, to=4, length=500)
distr <- rlnorm(y, 1, 0.25)
sam <- sample(distr, 100, replace=FALSE)
#calculate mean and variance
mean(sam)
var(sam)
```
The mean of the sample is 2.8304 and the variance is 0.5379.

#Histogram of the sample
```{r}
hist(sam)
```

#Histogram of sample in log scale
```{r}
hist(log(sam))
```
